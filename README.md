# 1. Travel Review Rating Dataset Analysis: Uncovering User Preferences Through Clustering
I'll be presenting my analysis of the Travel Review Rating Dataset, where I used unsupervised machine learning techniques to uncover user preferences in travel and leisure activities.

## 1.1 Problem Statements
Let's start by addressing the problem I am solving. The travel and leisure industry faces a significant challenge in understanding the diverse preferences of its users.
My goal was to segment users based on their ratings across various categories of travel experiences.
By doing so, I aim to provide insights that can inform targeted marketing strategies and service improvements in the industry.ustry.

# 2. About Dataset
The dataset provided from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wirachleelakiatiwong/travel-review-rating-dataset) contains ratings for different categories of interest, presumably for places or activities, by various users. Here's the overview of dataset. 

## 2.1. Context
This data set has been sourced from the Machine Learning Repository of University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine) : Travel Review Ratings Data Set. This data set is populated by capturing user ratings from Google reviews containing ratings with 5,456 users. Reviews on attractions from 24 categories across Europe are considered. Google user rating ranges from 1 to 5 and average user rating per category is calculated.
